## Unclear:
1. In section 4.4.1, in database generation, they claim that the inputs to the mechanism are best modeled as a vector of query answers. What doest this mean? Furthermore, the sample provided in Table 1 is also confusing, if two databases are adjacent, there should be at most one different record between them. How come D1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] while D2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]?
